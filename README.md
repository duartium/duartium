## 🎸 My personal interests

You have to relax putting on a good backingtrack and let yourself be carried away by different musical genres, especially if it's groove, fusion, jazz, blues or rock. I'm also an avid movie buff and always on the lookout for the next big movie. As a fan of Elon Musk, I am constantly inspired by his vision of the future and his dedication to making that vision a reality.

Thank you for visiting my profile. Happy coding!
